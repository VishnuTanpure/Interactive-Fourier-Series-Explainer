## Features  
- **Input Your Function**: Enter the function whose Fourier Series you want to find.  
- **Step-by-Step Explanation**: The code breaks down the process of finding the Fourier Series, explaining each step clearly.  
- **Visualization**: See the Fourier Series approximation of your function with interactive visualizations.  
- **Adjust Coefficients**: Increase or decrease the number of coefficients to observe how the series evolves and approximates the original function.  
- **Half-Range Series**: Find half-range Fourier Series (sine or cosine series) for functions defined over half the interval.  
- **Support for Discontinuous Functions**: Input discontinuous functions, and the tool will handle them effectively, showing the series approximation.  
- **LaTeX Outputs**: All mathematical expressions and results are displayed in LaTeX for better readability and understanding.  

## Requirements  
- Google Colab (recommended for running the file).
